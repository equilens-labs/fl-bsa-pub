# FL-BSA Public Artifacts (`fl-bsa-pub`)

This repository hosts **public, stable, website-linkable** release artifacts for FL‑BSA, published as **GitHub Release assets**.

## What This Repo Contains

- **Synthetic/demo-only** artifacts (reports + data) generated by CI from the private producer repos.
- Integrity and provenance sidecars (`SHA256SUMS.txt`, `manifest.json`) for each published release.

## What This Repo Never Contains

- Customer datasets or customer evidence bundles.
- Logs, runner filesystem paths, credentials/secrets, or internal-only infrastructure details.
- Artifacts committed into git history (all publishables are **release assets**, not tracked files).

## Stable Link Contract (For Website)

Use GitHub’s “latest release” download URLs:

- `https://github.com/equilens-labs/fl-bsa-pub/releases/latest/download/<asset>`

Versioned links use:

- `https://github.com/equilens-labs/fl-bsa-pub/releases/download/<tag>/<asset>`

## Expected Asset Names (Stable)

Not every release will necessarily include every asset, but names are intended to remain stable:

- `customer_report.pdf`
- `whitepaper.pdf`
- `WhitePaper_Reviewer_Pack_v4.zip`
- `gold_bundle.zip`
- `robustness_report.pdf`
- `robustness_plots.zip`
- `robustness_index.csv`
- `robustness_summary_merged.public.json`
- `manifest.json`
- `SHA256SUMS.txt`

## Verifying Integrity

Download `SHA256SUMS.txt` and run:

```bash
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS.txt
```

## Provenance

Each release’s `manifest.json` records the upstream commit SHAs and CI run identifiers used to generate and publish the artifacts.
